RECOMMENDED PLUGINS:
===========================================================================================================

If you take a look at the demo: http://demo1.chirothemes.com/ you'll see a map and a social sharing section in the footer.
The map was done with a plugin called "Google Maps Widget" which can be found here: https://wordpress.org/plugins/google-maps-widget/
The social media icons were placed with a plugin called "Social Media Widget" which can be found here: https://wordpress.org/plugins/social-media-widget/
The social media plugin has not been updated in two years, so you may want to look around for another if you have issues with it.

I also recommend another plugin that will allow you to add java script or CSS to your headers and footer. This is necessary to
allow for google analytics tracking codes, stylesheets for opt-in forms, facebook ad pixels, etc. I like that it doesn't try to do too much,
like add Facebook or Twitter data, so it doesn't conflict with the WordPress SEO by Yoast plugin.
The plugin is called OH Header Footer and can be downloaded here: https://wordpress.org/plugins/oh-add-script-header-footer/

Fast Secure Contact Form is recommeded for you appointment form. You can watch a video on how to use it at http://chirothemes.com
You can also download and import file from chirothemes.com that will setup the form for you. (Instructions are in the video)
You can get the plugin here: https://wordpress.org/plugins/si-contact-form/
